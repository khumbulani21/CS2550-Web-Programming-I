		<h2> Movement rules</h2>
			<p>
				A checker can only move one space foward to an open adjacent square. A checker can also 
				jump one or more opponent checkers diagonally to an open square adjacent to the last checker jumped.
				If you jump an opponents checker it is removed from the gameboard. If a player is able to make a capture, 
				there is no option the jump must be made. 

				When a checker reaches an opponents first row on the game grid it becomes a king. 
				A king is free to move diagonaly foward or backwards on the game grid.
