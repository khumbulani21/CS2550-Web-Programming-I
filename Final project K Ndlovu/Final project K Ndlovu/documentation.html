<h2>Satisfaction of requirements</h2>
<div>
The game uses javascript to load the game grid and set up the game. <br>
Players are able to enter their names which are then stored in local storage and used to indicate which player has won the game. Each player is also assigned a color<br>
Kings are able to move foward and backwards also capturing checkers in their moves. Kings are distinguished by their color which is different from ordinary checkers.<br>
Html5- I added audio to play sound in the background hen the game is being played. I also used canvas to print out some information about the game that is useful for players.<br>
