<h1>Progress</h1>
</p>

I have managed to develop the game grid and position the checkers in their initial positions. Input components have been added to the game grid web page for user to be able enter the player names and the checkers have color setup. Variables and functions for a checker have been added to the model javascript file. I still have to add the checker functionality into the game grid. The getCell() method for getting a clicked cell has been implemented.
Instructions
To be able to view the game board being reset to its initial state I added a button to create a new game.To be able to view the board being reset click on a number of cells then click on new game and it will reset the game board showing the initial state.  
To check the implementation of the getCell() method click on any cell and it should display the cell number that has been clicked.Clicking on a cell will higlight the cell with the checker the user wants to move and the functionality will be implemented later.
