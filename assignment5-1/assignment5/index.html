    	<h1>Game description</h1>
        	<p>
            	Checkers is an 8 by 8 grid board game which is played by two players. Each player has 12 checkers
            	which are placed on the dark squares of the board. Players take turns in moving their checkers.
            	The checkers can only move diagonaly forward toward an opponents side only on dark squares.
            	<br>
            	<br>

    	<h2> Movement rules</h2>
        	<p>
            	A checker can only move one space foward to an open adjacent square. A checker can also
            	jump one or more opponent checkers diagonally to an open square adjacent to the last checker jumped.
            	If you jump an opponents checker it is removed from the gameboard. If a player is able to make a capture,
            	there is no option the jump must be made.

            	When a checker reaches an opponents first row on the game grid it becomes a king.
            	A king is free to move diagonaly foward or backwards on the game grid.
        	</p>


    	<h3>Objective</h3>
        	<p>
            	The objective of the game is to remove all of the openents checkers from the game board in order to win the game.
